TicTacToe

A simple 2 player game of TicTacToe. TicTacToeV2 is an attempt to implement history in the game so it's possible to go back to previous states in the game.

The project is built with HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

Known Bugs
When TicTacToeV2 reverts to an AI's turn, the AI doesn't make a move and the player can take an extra turn.
